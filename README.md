## Feedback

Please note this project is not finished. 
I was given between 3-4 hours to complete. I took that time and this is as far as i got 

Happy to finish further if required. 

## Notes

I have taken a preference to programatic UI rather than using xibs or storyboards. Whilst slower to set up it scales much better

I didnt take too much conisderation around routing in this POC and the routing is not scalable in this code. 

I went with MVVM as a design pattern to try and make a clear seperation between view logic and buisness logic
